# Proves the markdown link gate can fail, before it is trusted to pass (#352).

# Each fixture models one way a link rots, and the gate is asserted to notice:
#
#   contributing-good/       what CONTRIBUTING.md legitimately does — relative
#                            links resolved from the file's own directory, an
#                            org link, a fragment, an external site
#   contributing-root-relative/  the #384 shape — a link that resolves from the
#                            repository root but not from the file, which the
#                            gate accepted while it joined relative links to
#                            the root
#   contributing-missing/    a relative link to a target that was renamed away
#   contributing-typo-org/   #351's `…/vyncint/temlens/…`, one letter short
#   readme-relative/         the packaged README with a relative target, which
#                            crates.io resolves against the crate directory
#   readme-missing/          the packaged README with a dead absolute target
#   pr-template-relative/    the pull-request template with a relative target,
#                            which GitHub resolves against the pull request
#
# The first and the last assertions are the ones that keep the gate honest: a
# fixture that must pass, and the repository's own files, which must still
# pass. Usage: tools/link-gate-selftest/run.sh
